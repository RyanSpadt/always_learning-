This is a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree. The main.cpp file showcases some of the features of the binary search tree.

This Project was made in Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.

Which includes:
- An in order traversal of the elements.
- As well as, a traversal of the elements in the tree.
- It displays the amount of leaves in the tree and the height of the tree.
- It also displays the parent and sibling of a desired node (if it exists in the tree) by element value.
