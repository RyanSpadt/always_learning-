This Project was made in Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.

It is an updated version of my older GPA calculator program found here: https://github.com/RyanSpadt/CPP/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/GPA%20calculator.cpp

I re-arranged the structure of the program to implement a header file and a class for the GPA. I was able to eliminate multiple variables and some redundancy.

The program performs these functions.
  1. Accept input from the user, pushing their input to the back of arrays.
  2. Takes that data comparing the vector data to local arrays to determine their equivalency.
  3. Outputs to the console the Cumulative GPA based on the input
  
What do I plan on adding from here?

  1. This program currently does not check for input errors. I plan on adding input error handling.
  2. I would eventually like to create an interface for this program.
